How to use the LIGHTNING BOLT:

1) Drag the "LightningSource" Prefab into your scene.

2) The gizmo of the object is the starting point of your bolt.

3) With the prefab highlighted you can use the editor variables to adjust your electric bolt.

Targets
4.1) Set at least one target for your bolt in the targets list to make the lightning visible. Click "Strike Once" to strike.
4.2) With the "Call method on impact" string you can call a method on each of your targets happening on impact. Make sure to type the correct function name.

5) The presets you can choose make sure that the lightning looks good after that point already. Use "Customize" to customize more details.

7) All parameters and methods can also be controlled and called by code in realtime (use the variable or method names displayed in the editor).

8) Combine several lightning sources and create untamed lightning chains! Be creative! It will only explode in the game!
